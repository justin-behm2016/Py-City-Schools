# Py-City-Schools
## Overview
This purpose of this analysis was to clean and organize student data from a variety of schools. The information for each school was then grouped and analyzed for a variety of factors: school spending, school size, and school type (district or charter). An analysis was performed to determine the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate of the students. Average math and reading scores from each school at each grade level were analyzed, along with analyzing the differnce made in passing percentages for Thomas High School once 9th grade test scores had been removed from the data (this was done due to evidence of academic dishonesty in this grade level). Overall, this analysis was completed to provide accurate testing results from a school district while providing several metrics to look into to determine future budgeting.
